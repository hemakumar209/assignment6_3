1. Use the given link Data Set.
Answer the below questions:
a. Perform ANOVA test on the discriminant analysis scores of nuclear localization signals of both nuclear
and non-nuclear proteins by class variables (Target).
  Ans:
     >data<-read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/yeast/yeast.data",
                       col.names=c("Sequence Name","mcg","gvh","alm","mit","erl","pox","vac","nuc","Class"))

     >df<-data.frame(data$nuc,data$Class)
     >class.ano<-aov(data$nuc~data$Class,data = df)
     >summary(class.ano)

     result:
              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    
data$Class     9  1.993 0.22141   22.01 <2e-16 ***
Residuals   1474 14.825 0.01006                   
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
         
b. Which class is significantly different from others?

   Ans:
    as the p value is very small no  class is significantly different from others


                             OR
    >data<-read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/yeast/yeast.data",
                  col.names=c("Sequence Name","mcg","gvh","alm","mit","erl","pox","vac","nuc","Class"))

    >head(data)

    >table(data$nuc)
    >table(data$Class)
    >df<-data.frame(data$nuc,data$Class)
    >plot(data$nuc~data$Class,data = df)
    

   by seeing the box plots we can say that all classes are same 
   no  class is significantly different from others
